                <div class="info">
                  <p>Due to the government's severe defunding of student support facilities at higher education institutes during the past few decades, Parsons, along with many universities in the country, was forced to close the student counseling
                    service on campus. Such a decision was inevitable despite the tremendous efforts of the administration and student-faculty organizations, and Parsons is distributing as much information as possible about alternative resources.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the need for student counseling service is immense, and the student body's mental wellbeing is at crisis. Anxiety and depression are most commonly cited concerns among college students, and reports about experiences of
                    severe depression and anxiety have only increased. Reports of suicide attempts have also risen. Subsequently, the number of students using university and college counselling centers has only grown for years.
                    Considering the consistent increase in the number of students with mental illnesses and the ever-growing demand for appropriate services, it is inevitable that the administration comes up with an alternative before this change
                    severely damages the wellbeing of our student body.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to resolve such a crisis in our community, our team sought a way to utilize the high end VR technology that the school has already invested in.
                    Thanks to the generosity of private donors as well as funding from the State of New York for VR/AR technology and its education, The New School's XREALITY CENTER has continuously grown in size and resources.
                    The equipment center offers rentals of cutting edge VR/AR equipment to all students, and the center's education programs offer various levels of tutorials for all students.
                    Thanks to its resourcefulness, the center is more than capable of expanding its reach to other departments of the university.
                    <br><br>
                    In collaboration with XREALITY CENTER, our team proposes to launch a VR group therapy course open to all students at Parsons.
                    The course will be required for one semester for every student, and in order to improve the general awareness and importance of mental health in the entire student body, and also to actively support students who experience mental
                    illnesses. Each class is led by an authorized counselor for the entire term, and students are free to drop or add the course within the general guidelines just like any other courses.
                    The course offers 2 course credits, but does not evaluate the students according to the standards-based grading system.
                    Our team is confident that VR THERAPY 101 will not only be an effective alternative to the crisis of the student body's mental wellbeing but also an important landmark in the exceptional education program at Parsons and an example
                    to other educational institutes across the country.

                    New York’s MTA subway service is crucial for the majority of middle/lower class New Yorkers to navigate their daily routines. Commuters spend a significant amount of their time inside the subway, walking in the mezzanines,
                    waiting at the platforms, or sitting inside the moving train cars.
                    The 2,865,066 estimated public transportation commuters account for 32% of all commuters in the New York-Newark-Jersey City area, and they spend an average of 51.3 minutes traveling to work.
                    MTA subway is the largest subway system in the world by its measurement, and the most used transportation system in NYC.
                    <br><br>
                    As an attempt to uplift the experience of the daily commuters and therefore make the lives of the average New Yorkers more positive, my team offers <i>Digital Scroll</i>, an illustration and animation art project set up in the
                    mezzanine of West 4th Street station in Manhattan. Under the main entrance floor and the A, C, E line platform at the mentioned station, there is an extremely long mezzanine with low ceilings.
                    Digital Scroll aims to take advantage of the large, unused space in the said mezzanine, turning the space into a platform for digital graphic artists as well as a fun experience of commuting New Yorkers.
                    <br><br>
                    We will set up long screen panels on each edge of the floor horizontally, so that the panels reach from one end to another, and showcase MTA-themed animated illustrations. The interface screens near the stair entries will give
                    the audience the freedom to turn on or off the illustrations, and activate or deactivate the animations on the graphics.
                    The screen saver function will help save energy during the slow hours. The long screens on the floor will create depth to the extremely flat, rectangular space of the mezzanine. <i>Digital Scroll</i>will offer a necessary
                    architectural addition to the particular structure of the mezzanine, and create a positive experience in the daily routines of the commuters at West 4th Street station.

                      I conducted an extensive research on one of the most controversial yet interesting AI technologies, deepfakes. Deepfakes is an artificial intelligence technique for human image synthesis. Using the machine learning data,
                      deepfakes
                      softwares can replicate human imagery of incredible qualities in videos or stills. Based on the online research and collected data, I conducted a 2D study and a 3D study exploring various topics of deepfakes technology.
                      Afterwards, with my expanded understanding, I created the collaborative portrait and a manifesto.

                    <p>
                      I focused my research on deepfakes detection technology and its fleeting success. Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a machine learning technology also used by deepfakes softwares, deepfakes detection technology
                      analyses
                      people's slightest facial expressions and demeanors, and uses the data to catch deepfake videos based on their lack of personal features. It detects the lack of subtle habitual expressions of people that the current deepfakes AI
                      technology cannot completely replicate. Some deepfake detection softwares are more than 90% accurate, and have been successful at relieving us with the promise of being able to tell what is real and what is not.
                      However, deepfakes technology is constantly evolving and its ability to replicate improving. And it is inevitable that detection technology rather helps providing information about what deepfakes technology is missing and how it
                      can be improved, especially because they both use the same source of data, GAN. Deepfakes and its detection technologies will continue to evolve, teaching and outrunning one another in turn, almost in a symbiotic way. The public
                      will have to fear for the complete inability to tell what video is real and what not, and depend on the ever-changing technology of deepfake detection.

                      I continued my study on the inevitably symbiotic relationship between deepfakes and its detection technology. Deepfakes detection technology is both the only reliable solution to and an important resource for further development
                      of deepfakes softwares. This realization pushed me to choose more primitive tools and study the very origins of visual analyses. Using charcoal, I drew multiple sketches of the same model in the same poses. Each time, my
                      observation of the model, recognition of her features, extraction of information, and the execution of imitation slightly differed. However, compiled altogether, the sketches would render a more concrete conclusions about the
                      model and her pose's visual elements. Repetitive sketching was an attempt to materialize my understanding of the core principles of visual data that, with countless additional complications, enables deepfakes and its detection
                      technology.

                      Human image synthesis has become of incredible importance and profit. AI technologies, such as deepfakes, create unimaginably impactful contents using the data of human image synthesis. Humans are breathing, living beings. We
                      are
                      changeable, vulnerable, and strong. Humans have appearance and mind, and they work together to make up the people that we are. But for human image synthesis, our visual elements, our imagery, have become mere data, which is
                      studied, compiled, and utilized for replication. And our data-lized elements are used as resources for the creation of false contents often with malicious intents and damaging consequences. This creates melancholia of feeling
                      compartmentalized, fragmented, and therefore, dehumanized. The result is a visual metaphor for such a melancholia in the form of a distorted portraiture. The image is both digital and physical, just as we humans are, and the
                      figure is both one entity and nobody at the same time, just as we humans are in our data-lized existence.

                      The moodboard is based on a film that uses enclosed spaces creatively.
                      I picked several images of spacially interesting shots and arranged them.
                      I wanted the primary spacial elements to be bed, screen, sunset, and moon.

                      Home is an emotional space.
                      Despite its conventional meaning as a physical space from which people are, home in a physical sense rarely provides the comfort and tranquility apart from the accompanying discomfort and drama.
                      Home is when one feels at home, and the feeling at home is within oneself.
                      I imagined my fantastical home that is within my emotional landscape.
                      This home involves some of my dreams, which only exist within my subconscience but in significance.
                      dream-homeland is a visual manifestation of the dreams and fantasies within the realm of home.
                      <br><br>
                      However, what if the meaning of home is already tainted?
                      What if one feels at home in a space of discomfort and drama?
                      What if humans are destined to homes that are never quite positive?
                      What if our dream-homelands are always meant to resemble nightmares rather than euphoric dreams?
                      dream-homeland is a space that acknowledges shadows along with the excitements of home.
