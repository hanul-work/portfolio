          <p>Hi, I'm Hanul. My name means "sky" in native Korean language and is a pure <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul" target="_blank">Hangul</a></u> word. I was born in the 90s and grew up by the ocean & mountains of South Korea.
            I've been studying, working, and living in NYC since 2018. Thank you for visiting my web portfolio site. Please feel free to look around!</p>

          </button>
          <div class="info">
            <p>
              My work varies from a 3D immersive VR narrative to a single self-written poem coded and animated as a website. The software tools and digital platforms that I use vary as much as the topics and themes of my work, and I continue to learn
              new technologies. My diverse body of work shares an overarching drive for subversion of structures and elevation of contents. I believe these two themes present themselves most brilliantly when explored together, just as structure and
              content enhance or supplement one another in close interconnection.<br /><br />
              Born in the mid 90s in South Korea and growing up in the early 2000s, I've had the privilege to witness the emergence of digital culture that soon permeated into all aspects of our lives. I've experienced the earliest online cultural
              services and participated in the online communities, such as the country's very first social network service <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyworld" target="blank_">Cyworld</a></u>, or the new digital comic industry <u><a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webtoon" target="blank_">Webtoon</a></u> that is produced, distributed, and appreciated entirely online. Both Cyworld service and Webtoon industry bloomed in South Korea during my teenhood. As an
              enthusiastic participant of both, I naturally grew an intimate understanding of innovative digital platforms that can create entirely new elements of our culture, and became fascinated with how such platforms can change our lives so
              intricately and powerfully.

          </button>
          <div class="info">
            <p>
              I work through design, technology, and art. As a multimedia designer, I create meaningful interactive virtual experiences using various softwares on online platforms. As a creative technologist, I seek new ways to use information
              technology and engineering tools. As a transdisciplinary artist, I capture and critique the visual culture of today and future with mediums like photography and video. Above all, I am a rigorous learner and an eager thinker, and such
              aspects of myself have led me to work with what I do today. The said intersection of design, technology, and art is as exciting as it is complex, as powerful as it is massive, and as hopeful as it is unpredictable.<br /><br />
              The brilliant thinker and leader of our time <u><a href="https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/" target="_blank">Ruha Benjamin</a></u> said: "Remember to imagine and craft the world you cannot live without, just as you dismantle the ones you
              cannot live within." My creative process involves re-interpreting the status quo from critical points of view, re-imagining its content and structure as thoroughly and freely as possible, and re-constructing them in virtual, digital,
              and/or
              online realms. I believe such a process of crafting various versions of the world and its elements helps us perceive a better world in our tangible reality.
